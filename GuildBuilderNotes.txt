Guild Builder

The Guild Builder would be an app(maybe smart contract) that would allow someone to configure (outside of any specific game) a Guild. This guild would consist of a suite of features defined by smart contracts. Ideally, the structure is fairly flexible (e.g. governance can be updated, tokens/roles added
