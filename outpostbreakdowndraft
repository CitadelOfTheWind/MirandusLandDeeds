This ain't no place for farmin!

Out in the wilderness of Mirandus, the battle-worn adventurer has little refuge. Where the monsters roam free only the Outpost keeps them at bay. It may not be expansive as the quiet hamlets where farmers and ranchers raise their stock far from danger, but it provides robust protection and the necessities wanderer will need. A place to rest, take some ale, hone your weapons.
